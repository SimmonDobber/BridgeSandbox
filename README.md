# BridgeSandbox
Simulator of bridge gameplay with sandbox features made mainly for game analysis. 
The project's main goal is development of algorithm which calculates the most optimal moves in game ending, which makes the topic of my engineering thesis.
Simultaneously with the simulator, I'm creating my own engine which is advanced and far more thoughtful version of engine applied in my tower defense game.
